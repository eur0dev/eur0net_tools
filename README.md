E0 network provides a complete set of tools
-------------------------------------------
E0 provides tools to allow easy block-chain validation, navigation, and viewing.

All tools are in Linux shell script which makes them open-source, completely transparent for everybody.

The shell script tools are distributed within compressed file called: e0.shell.tgz

To use just download the file and run under any version of Linux: gzip -d e0.shell.tgz

This will expand to several shell executable files. In addition, make sure that you have the expanded block-chain tree under the directory /usr/local/euro

./block_check.sh - running the program will validate the block-chain file for transaction sequence consistency and hash sequence consistency. The command can validate the block-chain for one hour or one day based on the input parameter format.
